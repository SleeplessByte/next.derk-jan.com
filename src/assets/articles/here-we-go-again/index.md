description: 'And what are these bits and pieces?'
---

I've written extensively before, especially when [I had cancer][website-blog-cancer]. The blog is not lost; still accessible through a sub-domain: [blog.derk-jan.com][website-blog]. The content is stale, the English is not that great, but it's still all there.

&ldquo;üìë Article Time&rdquo;. This is the name of a recurring event in my calendar that I added the first week of this year. Each day I want(ed) to give my self at least a single hour, completely dedicated to writing. It doesn't mean that I want to write each day, or that I have to publish an Article each day; it means that I have some me-time.

**And then I didn't use a single one of them.**

It's just not been a priority &mdash; It being &lsquo;me-time&rsquo; &mdash; and that's a Bad Thing‚Ñ¢. So. Starting today, I will once more put my thoughts on digital paper and publish it whenever I can. Both to clear my mind, but also to share my findings. I'll cross-post dev-related content on [dev.to][website-dev-to]; it will always have a home here as well.

As for _bits and pieces_: In 2015 I wrote a short poem based on some challenge, which has since been [the 404 page of the company website][website-404]. Here it is in full:

<article style="padding: 0px 18px;
    margin-bottom: 24px;
    border-left: var(--highlight) double 3px;">
  <header>
    <h2 style="margin-top: 12px; margin-bottom: 6px">Bits. And pieces.</h2>

Bits. Bits and pieces. Bits and Bytes. I see the spinner whilst it compiles. Waiting. Chunks of code. Bits and pieces. My mind reduced to machinery; logic; harsh, rude and singular truth.

_I **type**. I save. I press the button. I watch the spinner._

Code lights up as exceptions are thrown. Thrown exceptions, breaking the code in bits and pieces. Like a CPU, my mind goes into overdrive, heating up ever so slightly. Where did I go wrong, what did I do wrong. I think, I linger.

_I type. I **save**. I press the button. I watch the spinner._

‚ÄúIt works for me‚Äù, ‚ÄúNot enough information‚Äù, ‚ÄúBy Design‚Äù. Writing on the interwebs can only answer my lingering questions so much. Piece by piece I will find the solution and write the code, from mind to machinery.

_I type. I save. I want to press the button_

My mind wanders and I am lost.
